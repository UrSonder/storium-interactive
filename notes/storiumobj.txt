This updated data structure incorporates your new requirements regarding Player and Player_Character roles, and significantly revises the structure for Scene and Challenge.

Here is the revised architecture outline reflecting these changes:

Revised Storium.com Data Structure Architecture Outline
This outline shows the object architecture, including member variables and functions. Base members (id<int>, name<str>, descr<str>) are implied for most objects as noted in the previous response, but are listed where they deviate.

Object	Variables (Type)	Functions
BaseObject	id (int), name (str), descr (str)	getId()→int, getName()→str, getDescr()→str
Player (BaseObject)	player_characters (list[Player_Character]), hand (list[Card]), is_moderator (bool)	drawCard()→Card, playCard(Card), assignCharacter(Player_Character)
Player_Character (BaseObject)	remaining_cards (list[Card]), played_cards (list[Card]), owner (Player)	useCard(Card), recoverCard(Card), getRemainingCardCount()→int
Scene (BaseObject)	player_characters (list[Player_Character]), challenges (list[Challenge]), max_pips (int), unused_pips (int)	startScene(), endScene(), addChallenge(Challenge), updatePips(int)
Challenge (BaseObject)	min_pip (const int=1), max_pip (const int=9), default_pip (int), strong_outcome (str), weak_outcome (str), cards_played (dict[str,Card])	determineDefaultPip(int unused_pips)→int, setObstacle(Card), setCharacterCard(Card), resolveChallenge()
Card (BaseObject)	card_type (Card_Type), pips (Pips), is_played (bool)	getCardType()→Card_Type, getPipsValue()→int
Card_Type	index (int), name (str)	getIndex()→int
Pips	value (int), symbol (str)	getValue()→int

Key Architectural Changes:
Scene Pips Management:

Scene now explicitly tracks max_pips and unused_pips.

The unused_pips variable is crucial for setting the Challenge's default_pip.

Challenge Pips and Cards:

The Challenge object now includes min_pip (fixed at 1) and max_pip (fixed at 9).

The default_pip is a calculated value, with a function determineDefaultPip to handle the logic: min(3,unused_pips).

Outcomes are explicitly defined as strong_outcome and weak_outcome.

cards_played is modeled as a dictionary or map to store the specific roles of the cards:

{"obstacle": <Card object>, "character": <Card object>}

You're building out a solid structure! I'll continue to refine the architecture by introducing the Game and Pips objects into the full inheritance structure and ensuring all new requirements are cohesively integrated.

Here is the complete, final architecture outline of the Storium.com objects, incorporating all your requirements:

Complete Storium.com Data Structure Architecture
This architecture outlines the relationships, variables, and functions for all defined objects. The BaseObject variables (id, name, descr) are inherited by all objects except Card_Type and Pips.

Notes on Key Member Variables:
Scene.unused_pips: This tracks the pool of Pips available for challenges in the scene.

Challenge.default_pip: This value is set dynamically upon the creation of the Challenge using the logic: min(3,Scene.unused_pips).

Challenge.cards_played: The dictionary is structured to clearly label the role of the played cards, e.g., {"obstacle": Card_A, "character": Card_B}.

The obstacle card represents the environmental or plot point against the Player Character.

The character card is played by the Player_Character to address the obstacle.
