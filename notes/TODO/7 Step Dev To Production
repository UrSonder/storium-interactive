1. Project Initialization & Root Setup
Create a minimal index.html with a single root element (e.g., <div id="app-root"></div>) and only root-level CSS.
Set up your main entry JS file (e.g., main.js) that will bootstrap the app.
Ensure all library scripts are loaded and available globally or via module imports.
2. Style System & Group Definitions
Use css-management’s StyleRegistry to define all group-based CSS classes (e.g., for tabs, treeview, editor, buttons, forms).
Register these groups at app startup. No direct style attributes except for the root.
Document each group’s purpose and style scope for maintainability.
3. DOM Construction Layer
Build a set of modular UI group/component constructors (e.g., TabGroup, TreeviewGroup, EditorGroup, ButtonGroup), each responsible for its own DOM structure.
Use the DOM helper functions (from your libraries) to create and append elements, always assigning group class names from StyleRegistry.
Each group/component should expose a clear API for interaction (e.g., render(), update(data), on(event, handler)).
4. Data Layer Integration
Use databasegrok.js to load and parse the textarea data (or file) into an in-memory relational database.
Use storiumgamestate to encapsulate all game logic, state, and CRUD operations, acting as the only interface between the UI and the data.
Implement a “scaffolding” or “controller” class to mediate between UI events and data operations, ensuring strict separation.
5. UIX Logic & Event Handling
Implement tab switching, load/build buttons, and CRUD controls as event-driven modules.
All user actions (e.g., loading data, editing, building treeview, saving) should trigger events handled by the controller/scaffolding class, which then calls into storiumgamestate and/or databasegrok.js.
UI components should never directly manipulate data; they only display or emit events.
6. Data Serialization & Round-Trip Flow
Implement serialization logic (using databasegrok.js) to convert the in-memory database back to the text format for the textarea.
Ensure the round-trip: textarea → database → UI → database → textarea, is robust and lossless.
Provide clear user feedback for successful loads/builds and error handling for invalid data.
7. Refactoring, Testing, and Production Hardening
Continuously refactor any class exceeding 5 imports or 150 lines, extracting independent concepts into their own modules/classes.
Write unit and integration tests for all major modules (UI groups, controller, data layer).
Optimize for performance and maintainability (minimize DOM updates, efficient data access).
Document all modules, group styles, and data flows for future extensibility.
Result:
You will have a clean, modular, maintainable, and scalable HTML5 web app, with strict UIX/data separation, robust group-based styling, and a powerful in-memory data backend—ready for production and future growth.
