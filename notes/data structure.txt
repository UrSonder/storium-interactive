# Storium Game State Library: Architecture and File Structure for Tree View CRUD Interactive

The Storium Game State Library (`GameAPI`) is a JavaScript IIFE designed to manage the state of a Storium game, with support for a tree view CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interactive interface. The architecture is modular, encapsulated, and extensible, ensuring that game components (Game, Players, PlayerCharacters, Scenes, Challenges, Cards) are manageable through a hierarchical tree view. Below, we describe the architecture and file structure for a web-based application integrating the `GameAPI` library with a tree view for CRUD operations, tailored to the Storium game mechanics, including the specific card distribution for player characters (1 Nature, 2 Strength, 2 Strength Wild, 2 Weakness, 2 Weakness Wild, 3 Subplot).

## Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, with the `GameAPI` serving as the core model. The tree view provides a visual representation of the game state hierarchy, allowing users to perform CRUD operations interactively. The system is designed to:
- Encapsulate game logic in a single IIFE (`GameAPI`) to prevent global scope pollution.
- Support a hierarchical structure (Game → Scenes → Challenges → Cards, Players → PlayerCharacters → Cards).
- Enable CRUD operations via a tree view interface built with a library like **jsTree** or **TreeView**.
- Validate all operations to enforce Storium rules (e.g., `PLACE` card required for scenes, exact card distribution for player characters).
- Provide real-time updates to the game state and tree view.
- Support extensibility for additional features (e.g., AI-driven card suggestions).

### Components
1. **Model (GameAPI)**:
   - **Core Classes**: `Game`, `Player`, `PlayerCharacter`, `Scene`, `Challenge`, `Card`, `Pips`, `CardType`, `SceneNode`, `DigitalExistence`, `GameStateTable`, `GameValidator`.
   - **Enums**: `GameStatus`, `CardCategory`, `CardTypeEnum` (supporting `NATURE`, `STRENGTH`, `STRENGTH_WILD`, `WEAKNESS`, `WEAKNESS_WILD`, `SUBPLOT`, `GOAL`, `ASSET`, `PLACE`, `OBSTACLE`, `CHARACTER`).
   - **Public API**: Exposed via `GameAPI` namespace (`Types`, `Cards`, `Players`, `Scenes`, `AI`, `Core`, `Validation`).
   - **Key Features**:
     - Tracks played/unplayed status of cards.
     - Enforces card distribution for player characters (1 Nature, 2 Strength, 2 Strength Wild, 2 Weakness, 2 Weakness Wild, 3 Subplot).
     - Validates game state integrity (e.g., `PLACE` card for scenes, only Character Cards playable by players).

2. **View (Tree View Interface)**:
   - Uses a tree view library (e.g., **jsTree**) to display the game state hierarchy:
     - **Root**: Game (id, name, description, status).
     - **First Level**: Scenes, Players.
     - **Second Level**: Challenges (under Scenes), PlayerCharacters (under Players).
     - **Third Level**: Cards (under Challenges, PlayerCharacters).
   - Supports interactive CRUD operations:
     - **Create**: Add new scenes, players, characters, challenges, or cards.
     - **Read**: Display game state details in the tree or a details panel.
     - **Update**: Edit names, descriptions, or card assignments.
     - **Delete**: Remove scenes, players, characters, or cards (with validation).
   - Updates dynamically when the game state changes.

3. **Controller (Application Logic)**:
   - Mediates between the `GameAPI` and the tree view.
   - Handles user interactions (e.g., clicking a node to edit or delete).
   - Calls `GameAPI` methods for CRUD operations and validates results using `GameAPI.Validation`.
   - Updates the tree view and details panel after each operation.

4. **Data Flow**:
   - **Initialization**: The controller initializes the game via `GameAPI.Core.initGame` and populates the tree view with the initial state.
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - **Create**: Calls `GameAPI` factory methods (e.g., `GameAPI.Players.createPlayer`, `GameAPI.Cards.createCard`) and updates the tree.
     - **Read**: Uses `GameAPI.Core.getGameState().generate()` to fetch and display the current state.
     - **Update**: Modifies objects directly (e.g., updating `name` or `descr`) and re-validates via `GameAPI.Validation`.
     - **Delete**: Removes objects (e.g., removing a card from `PlayerCharacter.remainingCards`) and updates the tree.
   - **Validation**: Ensures operations comply with Storium rules (e.g., correct card distribution, valid scene setup).
   - **AI Integration**: Optionally uses `GameAPI.AI.createAgent` to suggest or simulate card plays.

        this.treeView = new TreeView();
        this.detailsPanel = new DetailsPanel();
        this.initTree();
      }

      initTree() {
        const state = GameAPI.Core.getGameState().generate();
        this.treeView.render(state);
      }

      createPlayer(id, name, descr, isModerator) {
        const player = GameAPI.Players.createPlayer(id, name, descr, isModerator);
        this.updateTree();
      }

      updateTree() {
        const state = GameAPI.Core.getGameState().generate();

  - Updates the game state via `GameAPI` methods and re-validates.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    class DetailsPanel {
      render(node) {
        // Display node details (e.g., card name, descr, isPlayed)
        document.getElementById('details').innerHTML = `
          <h3>${node.name}</h3>
          <p>Description: <input value="${node.descr}" /></p>
          <p>Played: ${node.isPlayed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
        `;
      }

      update(nodeId, updates) {
        // Update game state via GameAPI and refresh tree
      }
    }
    ```

- **src/utils/Validator.js**:
  - Optional utility for additional validation logic beyond `GameAPI.Validation`.
  - Example: Validate card distribution before assigning to a player character.

- **public/index.html**:
  - Main entry point with a tree view container and details panel.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Storium Game State</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
      <script src="assets/jstree.min.js"></script>
      <script src="src/lib/GameAPI.js"></script>
      <script src="src/controllers/GameController.js"></script>
      <script src="src/views/TreeView.js"></script>
      <script src="src/views/DetailsPanel.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="tree"></div>
      <div id="details"></div>
      <script>
        const controller = new GameController();
      </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

- **public/styles/main.css**:
  - Styles for the tree view and details panel, ensuring a clean, hierarchical display.
  - Example:
    ```css
    #tree { width: 50%; float: left; }
    #details { width: 45%; float: right; padding: 10px; }
    .jstree-node { font-size: 14px; }
    ```

- **public/assets/jstree.min.js**:
  - External library for rendering the tree view (replace with preferred library if needed).

## Integration with GameAPI

The `GameAPI` is the backbone of the application, providing the data model and validation. The tree view and controller interact with it as follows:
- **Initialization**:
  - `GameAPI.Core.initGame` creates the game instance.
  - `GameAPI.Core.getGameState().generate()` populates the initial tree view.
- **Create**:
  - Use factory methods (e.g., `GameAPI.Players.createPlayer`, `GameAPI.Cards.createCard`) to add new entities.
  - `PlayerCharacter.addCards` ensures the correct card distribution.
- **Read**:
  - `GameAPI.Core.getGameState().generate()` provides a structured JSON snapshot for the tree view.
- **Update**:
  - Modify object properties (e.g., `card.name`, `scene.descr`) and validate with `GameAPI.Validation`.
- **Delete**:
  - Remove entities (e.g., remove a card from `PlayerCharacter.remainingCards`) and update the tree.
- **Validation**:
  - `GameAPI.Validation.validateGame` ensures the game state is valid after each operation.
  - Custom validation in `PlayerCharacter.addCards` checks for the exact card distribution.

## Example CRUD Operations in Tree View
1. **Create a Player Character**:
   - Right-click "Players" node → "Add PlayerCharacter".
   - Enter name, description, and assign to a player.
   - Assign 1 Nature, 2 Strength, 2 Strength Wild, 2 Weakness, 2 Weakness Wild, 3 Subplot cards via `PlayerCharacter.addCards`.

2. **Read Game State**:
   - Click a node (e.g., "Narrative Train") to view details in the panel (cards, played/unplayed status).
   - Expand "Cards" to see `isPlayed` status (e.g., "Siren's Chorus" marked as Played).

3. **Update a Card**:
   - Select a card node (e.g., "Deus Ex Machina") and edit its description in the details panel.
   - Validate changes with `GameAPI.Validation.validateCard`.

4. **Delete a Scene**:
   - Right-click a scene node → "Delete".
   - Remove from `Game.scenes` linked list and update the tree.

## Notes
- The tree view ensures visibility of the card distribution (1 Nature, 2 Strength, 2 Strength Wild, 2 Weakness, 2 Weakness Wild, 3 Subplot) and tracks played/unplayed status via `isPlayed` and `PlayerCharacter.remainingCards`/`playedCards`.
- All game components (Game, Scenes, Players, PlayerCharacters, Cards) have `name` and `descr` properties, as required.
- The `GameAPI` enforces Storium rules, such as requiring a `PLACE` card for scenes and restricting Character Cards to players.
- The architecture is extensible for additional features, such as real-time collaboration or advanced AI strategies.

## Dependencies
- **jsTree** (or similar) for tree view rendering.
- No additional runtime dependencies for `GameAPI`.
